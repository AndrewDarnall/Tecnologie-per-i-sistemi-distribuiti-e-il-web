~~~~ Maven notes ~~~~

I would've used a jupyter notebook but it is currently 1:00 A.M. on a sunday....


- groupId: unique identifyer of the organization
- artifactId: name of the jar without a version
- archetypeArtifactId: the type of archetype to use in Maven
- archetypeVersion: the version of the archetype

--> After studying the Prof. Nictora's slides better and with more documentation
    I can say that Maven ... is .... COOL ! and VERY powerful, DEFINITELY the proper
    way to write code, because it solves SOO many problems

--> Checkout maven goals! {some are not necessairly bound to a compilation phase} 


To create the archetype for the servlet: -> maven webapp archetype

specific command:

- mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DarchetypeVersion=1.4

servlet_one is the by product of this operation

After successful configuration and code-writing, run: mvn build

A messed up web.xml causes the servlet to NOT deploy!

Maven can also automate A LOT of things that easy the DevOps philosphy

This first part has been a short overview of the manual building and deploying
of a servlet, without including the Docker deployment phase.
